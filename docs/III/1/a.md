# III.1.a. Movement

[Back](../../yooronder_yonder.md#iii-activities)

* Eight-direction
* Chebyshev distance (same cost on diagonals vs. cardinals)
  * This enables cardinal parity (distance) switching
  * Some games decide to have only cardinal movement, but have parity-switching:
    * Necrodancer, Rust Bucket digging/drumming/smashing/etc.
    * Sproggiwood waiting (boring)
  * I however think the entire cardinal-only movement style is boring
* Some enemies can only move cardinals/diagonals
