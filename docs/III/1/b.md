[Back](../../yooronder_yonder.md#iii-activities)

* Each regular turn is divided into four (4) time units
  * For reference: default move speed is 4 (3 up + 1 down)
* Each action may have wind-ups, channeling time or backswing time (wind-down)
  * For example: A conceptual parry takes: 1 up + 3 down = 4 (block on 2nd unit)
