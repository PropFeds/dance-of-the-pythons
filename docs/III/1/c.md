# III.1.c. Vision

[Back](../../yooronder_yonder.md#iii-activities)

* Have neutral light sources: sunlight, torch, lightning strike, fire
* The Locals: circular vision
* The Humans: maybe peripheral for stealthy gameplay
* Locals' default day vision is 9 tiles, meanwhile others' default are 8
  * This could create interesting sneaky behaviours, but untested
* Night levels reduce vision to 1 (maybe larger for Locals?)
